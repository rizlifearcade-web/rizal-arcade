    title: "Rizalian Values: River Quest",
    topic: "Rizal’s values and their relevance in modern life",

      "A correct answer moves the frog forward. A wrong answer costs one life and the frog stays in place.",
    ],
    scoring: "Reach six correct jumps before all three lives are lost. Correct streaks increase the score.",
    tip: "Read the short explanation after every jump—it tells you why the value fits.",
  },
  novels: {
    title: "Noli Case Files",
    topic: "Characters, plot, and themes from Noli Me Tangere",
    goal: "Clear the archive by matching six visual clue cards with their correct character, event, or theme cards.",

      "Pick up the solved archive slip, then file it under Family & Roots, Childhood, or Early Education.",

    ],
    scoring: "Chart eight randomized routes before all four travel permits are punched. Correct streaks and first-try navigation earn bonus points.",
    tip: "Do not rely on geography alone. Connect the dates, people, publications, institutions, and events in all three clues.",

    steps: [
      "Read the archive card and note whether it is a Timeline File, Evidence Check, or Rizalian Theme.",
      "Select the classification that best fits the record. On a phone, tap an answer; on desktop, use the railway controls or number keys.",
      "Press Confirm answer (or load the selected cargo on desktop), then read the explanation. Releasing a lever never submits an answer.",
    ],
    scoring: "Classify ten randomized files. Each correct answer earns 100 points, while consecutive correct answers add a streak bonus.",

    steps: [
      "Inspect the loose evidence, select or drag a fragment, then pin it into one of the four numbered thread positions.",
      "Fill the complete chain and test it; correct links lock in place while false links fall away and increase colonial exposure.",
      "Spend one of three lamplight clues to reveal a thread when needed, then read the debrief before unsealing the next file.",
    ],
    scoring: "Resolve six randomized files before four failed chain tests expose the operation. Clean chains and streaks earn bonus points; lamplight costs 20 points.",
    tip: "Build a sequence, not a list of facts: ask what creates pressure, which action follows, and what consequence that action produces.",
